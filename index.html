<h3> About Me </h3>
<p> I like to be creative -- it's how I thrive. I try to express myself creatively in any ways that I can. Whether that is in school, work, or at home, I am someone who looks at the environment around me and tries to a find a story to tell. When I'm not stressing my brain out in school, I am either relaxing with good music or working out to relieve the stress that is built up. </p>
